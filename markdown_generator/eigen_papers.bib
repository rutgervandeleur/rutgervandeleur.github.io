abstract = {Many cardiac catheter interventions require accurate discrimination between healthy and infarcted myocardia. The gold standard for infarct imaging is late gadolinium–enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI), but during cardiac procedures electroanatomical or electromechanical mapping (EAM or EMM, respectively) is usually employed. We aimed to improve the ability of EMM to identify myocardial infarction by combining multiple EMM parameters in a statistical model. From a porcine infarction model, 3D electromechanical maps were 3D registered to LGE-MRI. A multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression model was fitted to predict the presence of infarct based on EMM parameters. Furthermore, we correlated feature-tracking strain parameters to EMM measures of local mechanical deformation. We registered 787 EMM points from 13 animals to the corresponding MRI locations. The mean registration error was 2.5 ± 1.16 mm. Our model showed a strong ability to predict the presence of infarction (C-statistic = 0.85). Strain parameters were only weakly correlated to EMM measures. The model is accurate in discriminating infarcted from healthy myocardium. Unipolar and bipolar voltages were the strongest predictors.},

abstract = {Delirium, the clinical expression of acute encephalopathy, is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that is related to poor outcomes, such as long-term cognitive impairment. Disturbances of functional brain networks are hypothesized to predispose for delirium. The aim of this study in non-delirious elderly individuals was to investigate whether predisposing risk factors for delirium are associated with fMRI network characteristics that have been observed during delirium. As predisposing risk factors, we studied age, alcohol misuse, cognitive impairment, depression, functional impairment, history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, and physical status. In this multicenter study, we included 554 subjects and analyzed resting-state fMRI data from 222 elderly subjects (63{\%} male, age range: 65–85 year) after rigorous motion correction. Functional network characteristics were analyzed and based on the minimum spanning tree (MST). Global functional connectivity strength, network efficiency (MST diameter) and network integration (MST leaf fraction) were analyzed, as these measures were altered during delirium in previous studies. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relation between predisposing delirium risk factors and delirium-related fMRI characteristics, adjusted for confounding and multiple testing. Predisposing risk factors for delirium were not associated with delirium-related fMRI network characteristics. Older age within our elderly cohort was related to global functional connectivity strength ($\beta$ = 0.182, p {\textless} 0.05), but in the opposite direction than hypothesized. Delirium-related functional network impairments can therefore not be considered as the common mechanism for predisposition for delirium.},

@article{Plate2019,
abstract = {Background: The incorporation of repeated measurements into multivariable prediction research may greatly enhance predictive performance. However, the methodological possibilities vary widely and a structured overview of the possible and utilized approaches lacks. Therefore, we [1] propose a structured framework for these approaches, [2] determine what methods are currently used to incorporate repeated measurements in prediction research in the critical care setting and, where possible, [3] assess the added discriminative value of incorporating repeated measurements. Methods: The proposed framework consists of three domains: the observation window (static or dynamic), the processing of the raw data (raw data modelling, feature extraction and reduction) and the type of modelling. A systematic review was performed to identify studies which incorporate repeated measurements to predict (e.g. mortality) in the critical care setting. The within-study difference in c-statistics between models with versus without repeated measurements were obtained and pooled in a meta-analysis. Results: From the 2618 studies found, 29 studies incorporated multiple repeated measurements. The annual number of studies with repeated measurements increased from 2.8/year (2000-2005) to 16.0/year (2016-2018). The majority of studies that incorporated repeated measurements for prediction research used a dynamic observation window, and extracted features directly from the data. Differences in c statistics ranged from-0.048 to 0.217 in favour of models that utilize repeated measurements. Conclusions: Repeated measurements are increasingly common to predict events in the critical care domain, but their incorporation is lagging. A framework of possible approaches could aid researchers to optimize future prediction models.},

abstract = {Delirium is common in critically ill patients and associated with increased length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and long-term cognitive impairment. The pathophysiology of delirium has been explained by neuroinflammation, an aberrant stress response, neurotransmitter imbalances, and neuronal network alterations. Delirium develops mostly in vulnerable patients (e.g., elderly and cognitively impaired) in the throes of a critical illness. Delirium is by definition due to an underlying condition and can be identified at ICU admission using prediction models. Treatment of delirium can be improved with frequent monitoring, as early detection and subsequent treatment of the underlying condition can improve outcome. Cautious use or avoidance of benzodiazepines may reduce the likelihood of developing delirium. Nonpharmacologic strategies with early mobilization, reducing causes for sleep deprivation, and reorientation measures may be effective in the prevention of delirium. Antipsychotics are effective in treating hallucinations and agitation, but do not reduce the duration of delirium. Combined pain, agitation, and delirium protocols seem to improve the outcome of critically ill patients and may reduce delirium incidence.},
